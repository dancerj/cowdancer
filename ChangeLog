2005-11-23  Junichi Uekawa  <dancer@debian.org>

	determining the deb package to use.
	
	* Makefile (DESTDIR): export VERSION

	* tests/013_test_chmod.sh (TESTCODE): 
	* tests/012_test_chown.sh (NEWID): 
	* tests/004_test_fopen64.sh (TESTCODE): 
	* tests/003_test_fopen.sh (TESTCODE): 
	* tests/002_test_open.sh (TESTCODE): 
	* tests/001_test_symlink.sh (TESTDIR):

	* Makefile (VERSION): Change VERSION to be dpkg-parsechangelog-based

	* tests/012_test_chown.c (main): 
	* tests/013_test_chmod.c (main): do not test fchmod, fchown.

	* cowdancer.c (check_fd_inode_and_warn): do not die even if 
	fchown/fchmod is used; try allowing things to run albeit the warning...
	I am guessing test_pbuilder.sh is going to be non-functional.

2005-10-31  Junichi Uekawa  <dancer@debian.org>

	* tests/900_test_pbuilder.sh: update for 0.6
	 test fails for pbuilder test since fchmod is used here:
	
	    cowdancer-unsupported operation, read-only open and fchown/fchmod: 2049:274641
	    dpkg: error processing /var/cache/apt/archives/libc6-dev_2.3.5-7_amd64.deb (--unpack):
	     error setting ownership of `./usr/bin/gencat': No such file or directory


2005-10-28  Junichi Uekawa  <dancer@debian.org>

	* tests/013_test_chmod.c (main): 
	* tests/012_test_chown.c (main): expect fchown and fchmod to fail.

        * cowdancer.c (initialize_functions): chown, fchown, and lchown implementation. they look like the following:
	chown("/tmp/1/a", 1000, 24)             = 0
	fchown(3, 1000, 24)                     = 0
	lchown("/tmp/1/c", 1000, 24)            = 0
	fchown will be an unsupported operation, hopefully noone will use that.
	(check_fd_inode_and_warn, fchown, lchown, chown): implement.
	(chmod, fchmod): implement.
	chmod("/tmp/1/a", 0400)                 = 0
	fchmod(3, 0400)                         = 0
	
	* cowdancer.c (load_ilist): use calloc instead of malloc.
	(check_inode_and_copy): clear memory before match.
	Required to get working on my ibook. Probably the 
	structs weren't packed.

2005-10-08  Junichi Uekawa  <dancer@debian.org>

	* tests/012_test_chown.sh (TESTCODE): 
	* tests/013_test_chmod.sh (TESTCODE):

	* NEWS: 0.4 release.
