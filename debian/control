Description: Copy-on-write directory tree utility.
 Tries to make copy-on-write semantics upon hard-link copied
 directory trees generated with 'cp -la'
 .
 'cow-shell' command invokes a shell session. Within that session,
 under the directory cow-shell was invoked, 
 cowdancer will create a new file when existing i-nodes are opened for 
 write.
 Useful for quick scratch workspace and experimentation.
 .
 'cowbuilder' command is a wrapper for pbuilder which allows using 
 pbuilder-like interface over cowdancer environment.
