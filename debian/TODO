* Investigate fchmod/fchown
It is partially implemented, but difficult to really do.
open(, RDONLY) and fchmod/fchown is hard to do, because we're handling
inodes at that timing.

* cpbuilder implementation
A prototype exists, but I need a good test environment with network
connection, and a chunk of time allocated for it. A Codefest ?
