This directory contains support for experimental initrd support.

initrd support will create initrd on-the-fly to allow use of
Debian-stock kernel with ease.  Hopefully qemubuilder will be fed a
Debian package of a kernel from one architecture and start off it.


There are multiple implementations; pros and cons on each implementation.

1. klibc implementation

an initrd which uses klibc-linked binary to do everything

2. glibc implementation

an initrd which uses glibc-static-linked binary to do everything

3. shell script implementation

an initrd which is a bash script to do everything
