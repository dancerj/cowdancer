cowdancer for Debian
--------------------

This is a cowdancer.

Restrictions:
	Fundamentally really cannot work with chroot due to ld-preload;
		cow-shell needs to be invoked inside chroot.
		e.g. chroot /path/to/chroot cow-shell command-to-execute

	Might have some problems with fakeroot; although it seems to be 
working fine at the moment.
